# TyTris

## A tetris, built using Tyumi!

TyTris is a tetris clone, built using my roguelike engine/library thing [Tyumi](https://github.com/bennicholls/tyumi). I'm building it as a testing bed for the engine so I can figure out exactly whether or not I'm making good decisions there. The goal is to have TyTris be suitable as an reference/example game that users of Tyumi can look at. Also: maybe it'll be fun to play! Anything is possible.

Once it actually works and/or is fun I'll update this with instructions and the like.
